Exceptions in are handled using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks. The `try` block
contains code that might throw an exception. The `catch` block handles specific
exceptions, allowing the program to recover or log the error. The `finally` block is
optional and is used to execute code that should run regardless of whether an
exception was thrown. Best practices include catching only specific exceptions youcan handle and avoiding empty catch blocks that hide errors.
