Threads in allow multiple operations to run concurrently, improving performance, especially in applications requiring multitasking. The `Thread` class provides lowlevel
control over threads, making it suitable for simple scenarios. The `Task` class, part of
the Task Parallel Library (TPL), is more powerful and is used for managing
asynchronous operations, handling exceptions, and supporting more complex
parallelism.
