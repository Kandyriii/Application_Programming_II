`while` loop: Repeats a block of code as long as the condition is true. Suitable for
situations where the number of iterations isn't known beforehand.
`dowhile` loop: Similar to `while`, but guarantees at least one iteration since the
condition is checked after the loop's body. Useful when the loop needs to executeat
least once. `for` loop: Used when the number of iterations is known. It provides initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line, making it ideal for counting loops.
