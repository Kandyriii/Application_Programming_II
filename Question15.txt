Abstraction in is the concept of hiding the implementation details and showing onlythe essential features of an object. Abstract classes and interfaces are used to
implement abstraction. An abstract class can provide a base for other classes to buildupon, while interfaces define a contract that implementing classes must follow.
Abstraction is useful for simplifying complex systems and promoting maintainable, reusable code.
