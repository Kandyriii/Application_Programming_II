Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (fields) and methods into a single unit, the class. It helps control access to the class members by restricting direct access toprivate fields and exposing only necessary properties or methods. This ens that the
internal representation of the object is hidden from the outside, promoting data
integrity.
