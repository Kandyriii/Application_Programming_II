Inheritance in allows a class to inherit members (fields, methods, properties) fromanother class. The base class provides the common functionality, and the derivedclass extends or overrides this functionality. Access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`) control the visibility of members to derived classes. `public` members areaccessible from anywhere, `protected` members are accessible within the base andderived classes, and `private` members are only accessible within the base class.
